A chronologically ordered list of the actions taken during the hackathon.

10:45   -   Created git repository, and added README.
11:00   -   Read game rules and added initial version of input parsing.
11:15   -   Updated parsing of possible input types.
11:45   -   Added parsing of game settings and states.
12:00   -   Started with initial strategy of always killing a random opponent
            cell.
12:30   -   Started with implementing a new strategy ("Kill the live ones"):
                - Find out which cells will stay alive.
                - Kill random opponent cell from one of those cells.
13:00   -   Implemented "Kill the live ones".
13:15   -   Started with implemented a new strategy ("Sacrifice and rebirth"):
                - Sacrifice two cells that will die anyway
                    - If this is not possible, switch to "Kill the live ones".
                - Create new cell in a spot to keep a cell that will:
                    - Keep a different dying cell of my own alive; or, if not available
                    - Kill an opponent cell that stays alive.
13:45   -   Took a lunch break
14:15   -   Implemented "Sacrifice and rebirth"
14:30   -   Fixed bug in "Sacrifice and rebirth" where it only looked at corner cells.
14:45   -   Expand "Sacrifice and rebirth" to:
                - Prioritize killing opponent cells that will generate more cells.
15:15   -   Expand "Sacrifice and rebirth" to:
                - Prioritize sacrificing cells that are spawning cells for the
                  opponent.
15:45   -   Expand strategy to save own cells by checking coordinates that
            overlap. Prioritize the coordinate that saves the most cells.
